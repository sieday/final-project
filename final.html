          <p class="about_content">
            My name is Sienna Day and I am a student focusing on the
            intersection between geographic information systems and computer
            science. Over my last three years as an undergraduate at Portland
            State, I have delved into computer graphics, databases, security,
            operating systems and more to get a taste of the spectrum of
            knowledge that computer science offers. This has given me the
            background to not just use GIS software, but understand the inner
            workings of tools such as PostGIS, ArcPro, and QGIS to use them to
            their best ability and deliver a more algorithmically intensive
            analysis of spatial data.
          </p>
          <p class="about_content">
            Throughout university, I have also continued to expand my career in
            public health and community engagement. With Outside In, I have been
            a Youth Outreach Intern in charge of connecting with students and
            parents of a variety of different cultural backgrounds to deliver
            complex healthcare and program information. This outreach allowed me
            to stay grounded with the end user and communicate difficult
            healthcare information in an equitable and accessible way which
            transfers directly into house I think about both software and
            mapping. Both of these products are irrelevant if there is not an
            end user that can effectively use and interpret them. Currently, I
            work as a Site Coordinator for a pediatric clinic to optimize
            provider workflows, support clinical staff, and, overall, provide
            necessary and high impact care for historically underserved youth
            and their families.
          </p>
          <p class="about_content">
            It is my ultimate goal to combine all of these passions. Public
            health, computer science, accessible communication, and geographic
            information systems are themes that will continue to drive me. I
            know that effective products and effective teamwork comes from a
            multidisciplinary mindset, which I will continue to bring to the
            table.

            One of the first group projects that I worked on was for my CS300:
            Intro to Software Development class. This class focused on a ten
            week term project with multiple team members using a sequential
            development model. This included documenting requirements, design,
            and testing along with presenting a final product, This was unlike
            previous projects where I acted independently and on a much shorter
            timeline. The main intent of the project was to create a data
            management system for a fictional medical agency, Chocaholics
            Anonymous. The practice of documenting functional and nonfunctional
            requirements required me to think deeper about the intentions of our
            final product in a way that other projects did not. The final
            product included a basic user interface with inputs and an updating
            data structure behind it. Teamwork presented unexpected issues with
            everyone coming from a different level of knowledge and with
            different schedules, but with this project we got to overcome these
            logistical obstacles to create a functional product.

            This was one of the most difficult projects I have completed
            throughout my time at Portland State. This was my final circus
            project for my Computer Graphics programming intensive course. The
            prompt was to build a custom 3D animated amusement park from scratch
            using OpenGL. We were given a small virtual space and tasked to
            create rides and paths. My final project included practice in
            texture mapping, multiple hierarchical animated models, paramentric
            instancing, and a custom navigation system. This course required me
            to combine linear algebra with applied programming in a way that
            tested my ability.
