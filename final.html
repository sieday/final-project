            My name is Sienna Day and I am a student focusing on the
            intersection between geographic information systems and computer
            science. Over my last three years as an undergraduate at Portland
            State, I have delved into computer graphics, databases, security,
            operating systems and more to get a taste of the spectrum of
            knowledge that computer science offers. This has given me the
            background to not just use GIS software, but understand the inner
            workings of tools such as PostGIS, ArcPro, and QGIS to use them to
            their best ability and deliver a more algorithmically intensive
            analysis of spatial data.
          </p>
          <p class="about_content">
            Throughout university, I have also continued to expand my career in
            public health and community engagement. With Outside In, I have been
            a Youth Outreach Intern in charge of connecting with students and
            parents of a variety of different cultural backgrounds to deliver
            complex healthcare and program information. This outreach allowed me
            to stay grounded with the end user and communicate difficult
            healthcare information in an equitable and accessible way which
            transfers directly into house I think about both software and
            mapping. Both of these products are irrelevant if there is not an
            end user that can effectively use and interpret them. Currently, I
            work as a Site Coordinator for a pediatric clinic to optimize
            provider workflows, support clinical staff, and, overall, provide
            necessary and high impact care for historically underserved youth
            and their families.
          </p>
          <p class="about_content">
            It is my ultimate goal to combine all of these passions. Public
            health, computer science, accessible communication, and geographic
            information systems are themes that will continue to drive me. I
            know that effective products and effective teamwork comes from a
            multidisciplinary mindset, which I will continue to bring to the
            table.
